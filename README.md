# vim-config

My .vim configuration - a stripped down version of https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-config

To install it, do the following:

* Wipe out your `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory (back up if you wish)
* `git clone https://github.com/oldgit/vim-config.git ~/.vim`
* `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used, which is installed into autoload if it does not already exist.
* Start neovim with `nvim`
